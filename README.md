# K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) for Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements the k-NN algorithm in Python to predict handwritten digits.

## Data Source

This project uses the MNIST dataset, a large database of handwritten digits. The dataset is available at:

[MNIST Dataset](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. (2010). MNIST handwritten digit database.

## Setup and Usage

1. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

Note: On Linux or macOS, you might need to use `pip3` and `python3` instead.

## Project Status

This is an initial version developed as part of my AI learning journey.
